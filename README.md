## ADRC_4ODF_CDPR
   The cable-suspended parallel robot is a new type of parallel mechanism that uses cables instead of rigid links to connect the moving and static platforms. Compared with traditional parallel robots, it has the advantages of fast moving speed and large working space. At the same time, due to its simple structure and wide range of applications, it is widely used in fields such as processing and assembly, wind tunnel experiments, medical rehabilitation, etc.   
   悬索并联机器人是一种以悬索替代刚性连杆连接动、静平台的新型并联机构。相较于传统构型的并联机器人，它具有移动速度快、工作空间大等优点。同时因其具有结构简单、适用范围广的优点，它被广泛应用于加工装配、风洞实验、医疗康复等领域。  
   This work selects a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel robot with translational freedoms in the x, y, and z directions and a rotational freedom in the z direction, driven by four motors connected to four sets of parallel suspension cables, as the subject for dynamic modeling verification and control algorithm design. The specific contents are as follows: A dynamic model is established for the four-DOF parallel robot with parallel cable groups using the Lagrange method. Polynomial planning is employed to generate point-to-point, circular, and gate-shaped trajectories, and a virtual prototype of the cable-suspended parallel robot is constructed to verify the validity of the dynamic model. An active disturbance rejection controller based on the dynamic model is designed to enable the robot to move along preset desired trajectories.

   The simulation results show that the virtual prototype designed and built in this paper can reflect the dynamic characteristics of the cable-suspended parallel robot relatively accurately, and the control algorithm adopted can achieve good trajectory tracking control while maintaining good stability.

   Underwater robots play a vital role in the exploration and development of underwater resources. The unstructured characteristics of the underwater environment, such as wind, waves, ocean currents, and other factors, make it a complex system that is nonlinear, highly coupled, redundant, and time-varying, which greatly increases the difficulty of modeling and motion control.  
   在水下资源的勘探与开发的过程中，水下机器人发挥着至关重要的作用。水下环境的非结构化特征，如风力、海浪和洋流等因素，使其成为一个非线性、高度耦合、具有冗余性和时变性的复杂系统，这大大增加了其建模与运动控制的难度。

   Firstly, the 9-degree-of-freedom (DOF) overall dynamic equation of UVMS is established. Then, based on the UVMS dynamic equation, a virtual prototype model is designed, and the simulation results are compared with the model established in Mathematica software to verify the correctness of the simulation results. Finally, the motion control of the underwater robotic arm is designed. PD and sliding mode controllers are designed based on trajectory tracking. Through analysis and comparison of simulation results, it is found that the sliding mode controller exhibits better performance in achieving trajectory tracking of underwater robotic arms.    
   首先建立UVMS的9自由度UVMS整体动力学方程。 之后基于UVMS动力学方程设计虚拟样机模型，并将仿真结果与Mathematica软件中所建立模型进行对比，验证仿真结果的正确性。 最后针对水下机械臂运动控制进行设计，基于轨迹跟踪设计了 PD和滑模控制器，通过仿真结果分析对比发现，滑模控制器在实现水下机械臂轨迹跟踪方面展现出更优的性能。
